# hello-world-go

A "Hello, World" program often illustrates the basic syntax of a programming language. It was first published in 1978 in _The C Programming language_ book and then the tradition is continued to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. 

Here, I am attempting a fun extension which tries to introduce other common syntax or concepts by writing programs which has the same traditional output "Hello, World". Here, I am doing it for Go programming language.
