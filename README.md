A "hello, world" program is a program which outputs or displays "hello, world" message. It often illustrates the basic syntax of programming language. Perhaps, this tradition was started from the book The C Programming Language, by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, 1978.

Recently, mostly for fun learning, I've started writing "hello, world" program to try out Go language. I think it becomes easy to understand the code syntax and concepts, if you already know what output the code is going to have.Â 
In this blog post, I am showing you the initial list of "hello, world" program, which I plan to keep updating and adding more over a period of time. I would be glad to hear your feedback and open to your contributions to make it a useful resource.
