A "hello, world" program is a program which outputs or displays "hello, world" message. It often illustrates the basic syntax of programming language. Perhaps, this tradition was started from the book The C Programming Language, by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, 1978.

Recently, I started writing "hello, world" program to illustrate Go language syntax. Note, it is purely for fun and my own learning. I think it is  easy to understand the code syntax if you already know what output the code is going to have. Like, while reading program doing  number sorting it is easier to follow the steps in the code, as you know the final outcome.

If people find it useful, I will be glad to try extending it to introduce other concepts, patterns and popular third party libraries. I would be glad to hear your feedback and open to your contributions to make it a useful resource.
